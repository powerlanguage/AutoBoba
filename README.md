# AutoBoba

Tired of always ordering the same kind boba, I wrote a super shitty script to select a random drink plus toppings. (It will actually work on the offerings of any restaurant listed on Caviar.)

In order to have some visual feedback the script will scroll and pause at the options being selected, giving a sense of contemplation.

To run *AutoBoba* copy and paste the `AutoBoba.js` file into your browsers console whilst on a caviar restaurant page and then type `autoBoba()`.

This project was inspired by [Max Goodhart's Picnic](https://github.com/chromakode/picnic).
